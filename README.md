## About the Project  
The **Princess Carriage Line-Following Vehicle** was developed as part of the **EGN 3000L: Foundations of Engineering Lab** course at the University of South Florida.  

The project involved designing, fabricating, and programming a small autonomous vehicle that could follow a black line path using sensors and an Arduino microcontroller.  
The vehicle was presented at the end-of-semester engineering showcase and demonstrated teamwork, software development, and 3D design skills.  

---

## Motivation  
The project goal was to learn how to integrate mechanical design, electrical systems, and software control into a single functioning product.  
As the **design lead**, I focused on creating a unique, visually appealing **princess carriage body** while ensuring the vehicle remained structurally balanced and functional.  

This project also strengthened my understanding of **C++ programming**, **Arduino systems**, and **Autodesk Fusion 360 CAD modeling**.
